# OCDFE

## One-class deep feature extraction

Code accompanying the paper "One-class deep feature extraction of nonlinear independent components for gearbox anomaly detection" by Xiaoyun Gong, Mengxuan Hao, Chuan Li, Wenliao Du, and Ziqiang Pu (Ready to be submitted for publication).

* Tensorflow 2.0 implementation
* Inspired by Laurent **_et al_**.
[nice.py](https://github.com/bojone/flow/blob/master/nice.py): NICE (Non-linear Independent Components Estimation, [intro]( https://kexue.fm/archives/5776))
* Inspired by SeyfioÄŸlu **_et al_**. DCAE (Deep convolutional autoencoder for radar-based classification of similar aided and unaided human activities)


# Requirements

* Python 3.6.0
* Keras == 2.8.0 
* Tensorflow == 2.8.0

# File description


* `train_sufd_nice`:   The ACM and STM modules in the model OCDFE we built.
* `train_sufd_dcae`:   The CPM modules in the model OCDFE we built.
* `sample_nice`:       The logarithmic probability distribution of independent decoupling feature set is obtained.
* `sample_dcae`:       Obtain a low-dimensional depth feature set.
* `t_SNE_utils`:       t-SNE package for 2-D visualization.

# Implementation details

* The proposed method is implemented in the TensorFlow framework. The OCDFE model was trained using the provided training set
* In the training phase, 32 batches with 100 iterations each were employed. The optimizer of choice was Adam, configured with a learning rate of 0.00001.
* The activation function utilized in the model was the Leaky Rectified Linear Unit (Leaky ReLU).

Executed using the TensorFlow framework, the method initiated by utilizing ACM and STM to decouple the original vibration signal features, granting individual meanings to each feature. Subsequently, an encoder encompassing CPM functions as a feature extractor, learning features by mapping the data to the inner layers.      |
